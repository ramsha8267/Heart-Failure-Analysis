# HEART FAILURE ANALYSIS

![ipl-cricket]( https://thumbs.gfycat.com/ConstantWeirdCavy-max-1mb.gif)


Data Analysis with Heart Failure dataset.

Dataset has been downloaded from Kaggle and it can be found in Data folder in my repository.

# Cardiovascular Diseases

  Cardiovascular diseases kill approximately 17 million people globally every year and they mainly exhibit as myocardial infarctions and heart failures. Heart failure   (HF) occurs when the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the needs of the body.This dataset contains 13 features, which reports clinical, body and lifestyle information of a patient namely Age, Anaemia, High Blood Pressure, Creatinine Phosphokinase (CPK), Diabetes, Ejection Fraction, Sex, Platelets, Serum Creatinine,Serum Sodium, Smoking Habit etc.
  
  

## Analysis
    O How many numbers of patients are there in our observation? Out of them how many male and female patients are there?


    O What is the normal level of Ejection Fraction? How many patients had abnormal Ejection Fraction?


    O  What is the normal level of Platelets Count? How many patients had abnormal Platelets Count?


    O  What is the normal level of Creatinine in the blood? How many patients had abnormal Creatinine level?


    O What is the normal level of Sodium in the blood? How many patients had abnormal Sodium level?


    O How many patients had smoking habit? out of them how many male and female patients are there?


    O How many patients had anaemia or diabetes or high blood pressure?


    O How many patients had both (anaemia & diabetes) or (anaemia & high blood pressure) or (diabetes & high blood pressure)? And how many patients had all three?


    O How many patients died during the follow-up period? out of them how many male and female patients are there


    O Which disease / abnormality is most common and least common among the heart failure patients?


    O Does smoking habit affects the life of a heart failure patient?

    
    O Number of Patients with Anaemia


    O Number of Patients with Diabetes


    O Number of Patients with High Blood Pressure


    O Number of Patients with Smoking Habit


    O Number of Patients died during follow-up period


    O Number of Patients with Abnormal Ejection Fraction


    O Number of Patients with Abnormal Platelets Count


    O Number of Patients with Abnormal Creatinine level in the blood


    O Number of Patients with Abnormal Sodium level in the blood

## Quick Overview

Must begin with a pandas DataFrame containing 'wide' data where:

    1.Every dataset represents a different data.

    2.Each column holds the value for a particular category.

The data below is an example of properly formatted data.

## Conclusions
  
â€¢	Based on the recorded patients gender, we can infer that the dataset is slightly imbalanced, since only 35.1% of Patients were Female.

â€¢	We have more number of patients under 60-65 age group and the next place goes to 50-55 age group. And the number of patients recorded starts declining from 65-70 age group, it's obvious since the life expectancy of a person in Pakistan in 2015 was approximately 67 years.

â€¢	The abnormality in Ejection Fraction(EF) is the most common factor among the heart failure patients. Abnormal Ejection Fraction is followed by the abnormal creatinine and sodium level in the blood respectively, the factor which is least common among the heart failure patients is abnormal Platelets Count (i.e only 47 Patients).

â€¢	The most common abnormality or disease among the heart failure patients is Ejection Fraction and 261 Patients had abnormal Ejection Fraction.

â€¢	The least common abnormality or disease among the heart failure patients is Abnormal Platelets Count and 47 Patients had abnormal Platelets Count.

â€¢	Though they had normal ejection fraction and normal creatinine level in the blood, some patients with smoking habit died. So, we can conclude that the smoking habit has little impact on the life expectancy of a heart failure patient.
